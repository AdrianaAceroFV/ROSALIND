# ROSALIND

Collection of Bioinformatic problems from https://rosalind.info/

It is focused on the following topics:

## 1. Bioinformatics Stronghold
A variety of bioinformatics topics: computational mass spectrometry, alignment, dynamic programming, genome assembly, genome rearrangements, phylogeny, probability, string algorithms and others.

### 1.1. DNA - counting nucleotides

A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word; the length of a string is the number of symbols that it contains.

An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."

Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.

Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.

## 2. Bioinformatics Armory
Ready-to-use software tools abound for bioinformatics analysis. In the Armory are similar problems by using existing tools.
